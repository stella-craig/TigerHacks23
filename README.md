# Reel Life

Welcome to Reel Life, a Windows video game! You play as a time traveler, but when testing your time machine, everything goes wrong and you are transported in time to the different eras of film.
Work your way through each stage to reach the modern day once again.
The enemies are different forms of media, but as a result of our time-traveling disaster, most of the enemies are in the wrong era!
Throughout each level, you can collect popcorn (instead of coins)! Can you collect them all?
Be careful though, the game is permadeath! All levels have been tested and are possible.

Note: This was a project for the TigerHacks 2023 Hackathon.

## Level 1: Silent Era

The Silent Era was an era of film before cameras could record sound. Our focus is on the 1920s with films like those starring Charlie Chaplin. The level is in black and white and has no audio at all to show these aspects of this time period. The main enemy is a car from the 1920s. Don't get run over!

## Level 2: Studio Era

The Studio Era was in the 1930s and sound is finally in film! Also, by the end of the era, color had started to come to film. This era is known for classic horror films and The Wizard of Oz. To show all of this, the level starts off in black and white, then transitions to color, as this time period was a transition to color film. Also, the level is in the shape of a zombie, as a homage to classic horror films. Also, the background and level assets are references to The Wizard of Oz. Also, this is our first level with sound. The enemy in this level is a 1970s television.

## Level 3: Film Noir

Film Noir was an era of crime dramas popular in the 1940s. It was known for its dramatic vibes and black-and-white style with dramatic lighting. This is all shown in the level. Also, the level takes on the atmosphere of a dark city, as most Film Noir films were often set in cities. The enemies in this level are newspapers. Don't get a paper cut (they are deadly)!

## Level 4: Blockbuster Era

The Blockbuster Era was in the 1970s and was a major advancement in the popularity of Hollywood. This level is themed around the popular film Jaws (1975). Watch out for the water, as stepping in it results in an instant death as you'd get eaten by the sharks. The enemy in this a vinal record.

## How We Made It

We built this using Godot Game Engine. This was the first time any of us had made a game, let alone this specific engine or scripting language so it had a bit of a learning curve to it. Many of the assets were handmade, and if not, they are credited in the credits.txt file.
