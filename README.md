Welcome to Reel Life! You play as a time traveler, but when testing your time machine, everything goes wrong and you are transported in time to the different eras of film.
Work your way through each stage to reach the modern day once again.


Note: This was a project for the TigerHacks 2023 Hackathon.

## Level 1: Silent Era

The Silent Era was an era of film before cameras could record sound. Our focus is on the 1920s with films like those starring Charlie Chaplin. The level is in black and white and has no audio at all to show these aspects of this time period. 

## Level 2: Studio Era

The Studio Era was in the 1930s and sound is finally in film! Also, by the end of the era, color had started to come to film. This era is known for classic horror films and The Wizard of Oz. To show all of this, the level starts off in black and white, then transitions to color, as this time period was a transition to color film. Also, the level is in the shape of a zombie, as a homage to classic horror films. Also, the background and level assets are references to The Wizard of Oz. Also, this is our first level with sound.

## Level 3: Film Noir

Film Noir was an era of crime dramas popular in the 1940s. It was known for its dramatic vibes and black-and-white style with dramatic lighting. This is all shown in the level. Also, the level takes on the atmosphere of a dark city, as most Film Noir films were often set in cities.

## Level 4: Blockbuster Era

The Blockbuster Era was in the 1970s and was a major advancement in the popularity of Hollywood.
